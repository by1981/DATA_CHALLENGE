				<h4 class="header2">Poverty Versus Stroke</h4>
				<p>  Poverty is the state of someone who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of wealth or material possessions. Poverty can be at a social, economical, or personal level. People who are poor generally can not afford health insurance and do not visit hopsital for regular checkups. These people tend to overlook symptoms. In this survey, a correlation between percentage of poverty and percentage of strokes is studied. The correlation coefficient of 0.71 is observed between poverty and stroke, indicating that people under poverty are more susceptible to strokes</p>
